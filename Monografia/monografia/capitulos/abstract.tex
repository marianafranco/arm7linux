Mobile devices such as smartphones, MP3 players and portable video-games are becoming ubiquitous. Low power processors are essential in this market, where the English company ARM is the leader. In order to upgrade the equipment being used in the classes, ARM provided a set of ARM Evaluator 7-T boards to the Escola Polit\'ecnica. It has the ARM7TDMI processor, which is used in popular devices such as the Apple iPod and the Nintendo DS.

Using this updated hardware and willing to unite the Operating Systems and Microprocessors Laboratory courses, this project aims the development of a microkernel for the ARM Evaluator 7-T board, which would encompass both courses.

The microkernel, named KinOS, has some basic functions. It is the first step towards a bigger project, the development of a operating system totally created by the Escola Polit\'ecnica students.

The functions encompassed by this microkernel include the thread switching, some system calls (fork, exec and exit), functions for peripheral manipulation, and shell communication.
